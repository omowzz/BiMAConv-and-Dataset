# BiMAConv-and-Dataset
The point cloud provided by the 2018 IEEE GRSS data fusion competition has only 5 category labels in the initial state, and the three spectral channels (1550nm, 1064nm, 532nm) are stored by three independent point cloud data. In order to improve the original data, we use the KD tree data structure to process the three point cloud data, fuse the features of the point clouds with similar spatial positions, generate a new point cloud data, and expand the point cloud feature channels. At the same time, we fuse the three-dimensional point cloud with the two-dimensional label according to the lidar affine transformation, and expand the point cloud data category. Then the point cloud is divided into blocks, denoised and downsampled, and data enhancement is performed at the same time. Finally, the data is divided. Since some categories (such as water) have fewer points, we randomly divide the point cloud blocks containing these areas into 8:2, and then divide the remaining point cloud blocks into 8:2. This divides the training set and the test set into 8:2.
